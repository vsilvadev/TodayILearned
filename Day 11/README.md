<h2>📚 Learnings of the day:</h2>
<p>Today I Learned about one resource in JS that I not prettend to use rsrs: Hoisting </p>

<h3>1️⃣ Hoisting: </h3>
<p>• Hoisting allows the programmer to use a var or a function before you declare it in code. Hoisting simply hoist the variable upwards since it was called for use before it was created.<p>
