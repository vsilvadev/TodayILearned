<h2>📚 Learnings of the day:</h2>
<p>Today I learned about arrays. A must-have object in JavaScript</p>
<h3>1️⃣ Arrays: </h3>
<p>Array is an indexed structure where its elements are enclosed in square brackets and a comma separates the elements. It is a structure that can be heterogeneous (can mix data).</p>
<h4>Learning how to manipulate arrays:</h4>
<p>• Creating an array.</p>
<p>• Searching and printing an element by index.</p>
<p>• Insert elements into the array</p>
<p>• Insert an element in the last position of the array.</p>
<p>• Delete elements from the array.</p>
