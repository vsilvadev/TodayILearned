<h1 align="center">💻 Day 21 💻</h1>

<h2>📚 Learnings of the day:</h2>
<p>Today I learned about If/Else and Else If.</p>

<h3>1️⃣ If/Else: </h3>
<p>• Showing how it is possible to use the else to return a result if the if condition has not been met. </p>

<h3>2️⃣ If/Else If: </h3>
<p>• We can use an if together with the else to check another condition in our code in a very simple way, in this file I show an example of how to accomplish this. </p>
