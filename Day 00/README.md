<h2>📚 Learnings of the day:</h2>

<h3>4️⃣ Weakly Typed: </h3>
<p>JS is a programming language known for being weakly typed</p>
<h4>❗ Weakly Typed VS Strongly Typed</h4>
<p><b>Weakly Typed:</b> In a weakly typed language the type of the variable does not need to be defined in its declaration and that variable can take on different values ​​and different types </p>
<p><b>Strongly Typed:</b> Each variable in the scope of the program represents a well-defined type, that is, you will be required to declare the type of the variable you will be declaring. </p>
