<h2>📚 Learnings of the day:</h2>
<p>Today I learned about While and Do/While, two types of loops.</p>

<h3>1️⃣ While: </h3>
<p>• Creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. </p>

<h3>2️⃣ Do/While: </h3>
<p>• creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once. </p>
